# Minimum numbers to solve this

# Given five positive ints, 
# find the minimum and maximum values that can be calaculated by summing exactly
# four of the five integers

# arr = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
# the minimum sum is 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16
# the maximum sun is 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 = 24
# the function would print 16 24
